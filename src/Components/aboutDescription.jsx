      I am a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind, I enjoy to meet new
      people and understand how they are solving problems, this is one of the
      reasons why I invest my time on meetups from product management to
      everything related to design (research, design thinking, design system,
      etc.) and talking to people in general, as always can be an opportunity to
      learn something new. I see it as a chance to improve myself as a
      professional and put things in practice when I’m creating my solutions.
      Over +2 years, I’ve worked on a diverse set of mini projects, worked for
      myself on my skills, working from research to production, that include
      iOS, Android, web, SaaS, B2B, B2C, user research, data visualisation, art
      direction and marketing design. In all projects, I seek to simplify the
      relationship between people and the interactive products they use, taking
      into consideration business goals and technological constraints. I am
      self-aware of the impact our solutions have on people's lives, and this is
      the reason why I always give my best to create a seamless and delightful
      experience.
